## Enter your expected JSON-encoded data in this space.
## "[]" is required, i.e. should be a List of objects.

[
    {
##        "msg" : "Hello, World", "num" : 1
    }
]


## Tips:
##  * The sample data above will generate a single empty document, uncomment
##    the line in the middle to include the sample fields.  Adding more
##    objects to the root array will cause the snap to generate more
##    than one document.
